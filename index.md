## Welcome to My World of Code

Hello potential employer! If you're here from my resume, thanks for stopping by. I'm Adrian Bates, a computer science enthusiast with over a decade of hands-on experience. At 14, I built my first computer, sparking a journey that has evolved into a robust skill set.

# Educational Excellence
I'm not just passionate about code; I've backed it up with a solid education. I spent four years at Southern New Hampshire University, earning my Bachelor's degree in computer science with a perfect 4.0 GPA. Never missing an assignment, my dedication to excellence extends beyond lines of code.

# Passion for Programming
My love for computer science ignited through gaming and C++/Java experimentation. Over the last decade, I've been immersed in programming, particularly in video game development. From JWJGL in Java to Unity, my journey reflects a commitment to problem-solving through code. Not just a gamer, I consider myself a dedicated programmer who finds joy in crafting solutions and witnessing progress.

# Beyond Video Games
While my roots are in video game prototypes, my programming prowess extends beyond. I'm adaptable, delving into various projects. For instance, the creation of this website and the website for my [small business](https://ResinatingWithNature.com) using Jekyll and a customized theme involved mastering new programming styles and understanding site structure. I thrive in diverse programming environments, always eager to learn and contribute.

# Crafting in 3D
Beyond the digital realm, I immerse myself in the world of 3D printing and modeling. Proficient in programs such as Blender and OpenSCAD, I've translated my passion into a tangible business aspect. A fundamental part of my entrepreneurial journey involves selling 3D printed keycaps, showcasing the fusion of creativity and technology.

# Ready for New Challenges
Beyond video games and website development, I'm poised for fresh challenges. With a foundation in adaptability and a passion for problem-solving, I believe I can seamlessly integrate into any project with the right documentation and guidance.
