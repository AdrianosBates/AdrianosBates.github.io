And welcome to my personal site. If you've found yourself here, you're likely a potential employer who got this
link from my resume. So let me tell you a little about myself, or you can get right into my projects using the navbar up top.

My name is Adrian Bates, and I'm a long time computer science enthusiast. I first began my journey in computer
science when I built my first computer at age 14, over ten years ago (as of 2023). These days [my computer]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2023-09-23-my-pc.md %}) has
gotten a bit more advanced.

Playing PC games and experimenting with programming in C++ and Java sparked a passion for computer science that I've
held ever since. One of my primary hobbies during the last ten years has been programming, mainly programming video game
prototypes
using whatever software was popular at the time. Beginning with JWJGL in Java, and eventually moving to more mature
game engines with Unity. While my hobbyist programming experience is limited to video game development, I consider
myself a programmer first and foremost. For me, video games are simply an excellent medium for me to solve problems
using code, and visually see the progress I'm make. I also tend towards prototyping games that involve more than simply scripting simple objectives in a linear video game. For example, in "[Just For Fun]({% link _all-projects/just-for-fun.md %})" (which is a content-less clone of an old web-browser game called Q), I most enjoyed the time spent on creating the [algorithm for procedurally generating a mesh given a line segment](https://github.com/AdrianosBates/JustForFun/blob/main/Assets/LineToMesh.cs).

My programming experience is not limited to scripting video games, however. I like to think of myself as being very adaptable, depending on whatever project I may be currently working on. For example, setting up and maintaining this website using Jekyll and an accompanying theme involved learning several new styles of programming and the structure of how this particular site is generated. Given adequate documentation and direction, I believe that I could work well in any number of new programming environments.

For now this is all, but there is more to come for this website...
