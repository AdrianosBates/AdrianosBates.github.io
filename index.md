Hello! If you're here from my resume, thanks for stopping by. I'm Adrian Bates, a computer science enthusiast with over a decade of hands-on experience. At 14, I built my first computer, sparking a journey that has evolved into a robust skill set.

# Education
I spent four years at Southern New Hampshire University. My dedication and accountability has earned me my Bachelor's degree in computer science with a perfect 4.0 GPA, never missing an assignment.  

# Beginnings
My interest in computer science began through video games and learning C++/Java. Over the last decade, I've been particularly interested in the programming and systems side of video game development. I released a now defunct Android application that aimed to aid piano players in their sight-reading, but for other projects my focus on programming overshadowed the need to create a finished media product. In short, programming is more fun than designing UIs and rigging animations...

# Beyond Programming
I also have many skills and hobbies that extend beyond programming, and consider myself very adaptable. From static web development such as this website and the website for my [small business](https://ResinatingWithNature.com) to music, carpentry, photography, electronics, and importantly: 3D design and printing. 

# Crafting in 3D
As my interest in 3D printing began to grow, as did the need to become a proficient 3D designer. Through years of self-teaching and experimentation in programs such as Blender and OpenSCAD, I've translated my passion into a tangible business aspect. A fundamental part of my partner and I's business involves [selling 3D printed keycaps](/_all-projects/00-3d-printed-keycaps.md).

# New Challenges
With a foundation in adaptability and a passion for problem-solving, I believe I can seamlessly integrate into YOUR project with a little guidance.
