One of my main hobbies and business endeavors is the creation and sale of 3D printed keycaps. Using my skills in 3D modeling with Blender and OpenSCAD, I design and produce unique, high-quality keycaps that blend aesthetics with functionality. As of 2024, I have sold over 400 keycaps, turning my passion for 3D printing into a thriving small business.
